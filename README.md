# Stock-market-Prediction
Stock Market Prediction using LSTM and keras library for implementing it.
At first the data is processed in the batch of 60 Elements for the next prediction i.e the model is trained on the previous 60 days of
stock prices for the prediction.
Now the input data is reshaped in the 3-D Vector.
This data is fed in the Lstm Model built Using the Keras Library.
